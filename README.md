# FIFA 2021
## Project name: FIFA 2021
Find players easily by their Overall Rating, Potential, Rating, Age, Positions, Nationality, League, Club, Contract and Skill. Analyze players in detail. Our project is super easy to use. This project will be your best guide during the transfer seasons.

## Type of the user-interface, programming language and database server:
IOS mobile app , Swift, SQLite

## Why we have chosen SQLite?
SQLite isn’t the only way to persist data on iOS. Besides Core Data, there are many other alternatives for data persistence including Realm, Couchbase Lite, Firebase and NSCoding.|

Each of these has its own pros and cons — including SQLite itself. There’s no silver bullet for data persistence. As the developer, it’s up to you to determine which option surpasses the others based on your app’s requirements.|

SQLite has some advantages:|

Shipped with iOS, it adds no overhead to your app’s bundle.|
SQLite released version 1.0 in August 2000, so it’s tried and tested.|
It’s well-maintained with frequent releases.|
Open-source.|
It uses a query language that’s familiar to database developers and administrators.|
Cross-platform.|
